Title : Hello Edge : Keyword Spotting on Microcontrollers
Type  : estimate and proposal 
Area  : Keyword spotting via Deep learning for Microcontroller/Embedded products
Result: 95% accuracy on 20dB

Author’s main contribution: 
 - Estimated the well-known solutions
 - Proposed DS-CNN solution
Flash point from new leaner(me) side:
 - Shared a turn-key experiment code/solution, on Tensor flow speech commands and its dataset, which can allow me to start experiment
 - Code provided: https://github.com/ARM-software/ML-KWS-for-MCU
