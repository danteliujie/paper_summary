Title: Single-Microphone Speech Enhancement and Separation Using Deep Learning
Type : PhD Thesis, collection of 7 papers and review of related Areas
Area : Deep Learning for Speech Enhancement and Separation, single microphone

Author’s main contribution: 
 - Proposed training techniques: PIT and uPIT
 - Proposed a STOI inspired cost function for DNNs training
 - Analyze capability of recent deep learning single microphone speech enhancement/separation algorithms

Flash point from new leaner(me) side:
 - A good review with new updated reference list, providing the well-known team list.
 - Focus on training and evaluation part, which can help build a basic demo and learning system.
